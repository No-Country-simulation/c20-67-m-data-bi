Individuals who are hired will be placed in our unique Patent Agent Program, a forward-thinking, highly effective method for training and developing technically and legally savvy individuals. No IP experience is necessary. This is a great position to combine your technical skills with writing, client interaction, and legal concepts. A university degree in a technical field is required. Candidates with industry experience, particularly related to seismic acquisition or processing, and/or advanced technical degrees are strongly preferred.
Ideal candidates should have
Broad experience in exploration seismic, particularly in acquisition hardware, processing and interpretation algorithms for marine and land seismic, borehole seismic, and/or hydraulic fracture monitoring.
Knowledge of downhole tools and drilling processes.
Experience in research, developing, and implementation of hardware, algorithms, and/or workflows; and of communicating the principles underlying them, such as authoring technical articles or journal papers, is particularly desirable.
Demonstrated willingness to extend their range of knowledge to relevant areas beyond their core experience, e.g. AI / ML, sonic and ultrasonic applications.
Documented enthusiasm for and proficiency in technical writing, in English.
Written Communication assessment MUST be completed in order to be considered for this position. 
The Basics of the Patent Agent Program:
The Patent Agent Program serves as an apprenticeship in patent law. During the first year of employment, participants undergo a regular training schedule with a combination of in-house lectures and mentorship. During their studies, they also maintain technical expertise through daily application of technical knowledge by prosecuting patents. Upon completion of the one-year program, participants are expected to sit for and pass the Patent Agent Exam conducted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. After passing this exam, they become patent agents. Patent Agents are given the opportunity to attend part-time law school while continuing their education within the Firm.
Core Responsibilities:
Patent engineers are problem solvers. When writing a patent application, they are required to study the technology and learn about the invention. During patent prosecution, they may need to determine how the invention differs from others in the marketplace. They can expect to spend half the day reading and studying the technical analysis of complex scientific topics within a particular patent application. The remainder of the day may be spent writing and scheduling future projects. Some days may be focused on technology in one field, while other days may require work in more than one technical area. Patent engineers, in collaboration with patent agents and attorneys, continuously work together to solve problems on behalf of clients.
Qualifications:
Applicants must be U.S. citizens, permanent legal residents, or otherwise authorized to work in the U.S. Individuals who have earned or will soon earn a degree from an accredited U.S. University in one of the technical areas listed above with an extremely strong academic record (top 25%) are encouraged to apply.

The Opportunity:

Do you want to use your analysis skills to help the Navy get the most out of its funding? When it comes to considering the costs of building and maintaining systems, you know there is more to it than parts and labor. That's why we need you, a cost analyst who can turn requirements into a complete financial understanding for the Navy.

As a cost analyst on our team, you'll translate requirements into cost through data collection, model building, and cost and risk analyses. You'll help to develop recommendations that will impact how hundreds of millions of dollars are invested throughout the project's life cycle. You'll help identify cost data to be collected, develop data collection plans, and review draft work breakdown structures (WBSs) and cost reporting plans. You will extract data about the technology and performance of submarine communications systems and undersea integration systems through discussions with SMEs, engineers, and project managers. You'll derive meaning from raw numbers using a variety of data science techniques, like normalizing data, performing statistical regression, and using learning curve analysis. From modeling with dynamic formulas in Microsoft Excel to quantifying cost uncertainty with Monte Carlo discrete event simulation, you'll use your experience in analytics and data visualization to interpret and convey meaning. By developing total ownership cost estimates, you'll help program managers, senior leadership, and your client to plan and field systems on time. This is your chance to gain skills in naval systems while continuing to build your cost analysis experience. Join us as we help fuel our country's Navy with the funding they need.

Join us. The world can’t wait.

Senior Associate, Data Science - Retail Bank

Data is at the center of everything we do. As a startup, we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in computing and machine learning technologies and operating across billions of customer records to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time and agony in their financial lives.

Team Description

The back office of the future will help identify when we fail to help our customers, when our customers are satisfied, and further help our bank identify process failures. That future is already occurring. If you enjoy building and working with light web applications while forecasting all of the cash needs of our customers then a position on the Bank Operations Data Science team is the right spot for you. Our solutions run the gamut from basic time series forecasting to advanced optimization and focus on not only identifying potential issues but providing an interpretable output that front line agents can use to better help meet our customers’ needs.

Technical. You’re comfortable with open-source languages and are passionate about developing further. You have hands-on experience developing data science solutions using open-source tools and cloud computing platforms.

A data guru. “Big data” doesn’t faze you. You have the skills to retrieve, combine, and analyze data from a variety of sources and structures. You know understanding the data is often the key to great data science.

Basic Qualifications:

Currently has, or is in the process of obtaining a Bachelor’s Degree plus 2 years of experience in data analytics, or currently has, or is in the process of obtaining Master’s Degree, or currently has, or is in the process of obtaining PhD, with an expectation that required degree will be obtained on or before the scheduled start date

Description:
Position Summary: The Senior Data Analyst position has emerged in response to a federal mandate by the United States District Court Southern District of New York (SDNY) to help address systemic data architecture issues in New York City Public Schools (NYCPS). The analyst will work closely with the Director of Systems and Analytics, Senior Systems Implementation Analyst, and Software Database Architect to unshackle the agency from restrictive data siloes and grow responsive data ecosystems in their places. Together they will develop and leverage key stakeholder relationships to identify and build technical solutions to address systemic challenges related to leveraging analytics. The Analyst’s contributions will be vital in cultivating Office of Systems and Analytics (OSA)’s office culture that prioritizes kindness, excellence, transparency, and civic responsibility.
The role involves the application of advanced analytical and problem-solving skills to gather, analyze, interpret, and visualize data to inform legal strategies, policy formulation, and decision-making processes. The analyst will help lead the charge in deploying next-generation technology within the NYCPS, including Microsoft Azure, Power Platform, AI LLM software, and more, alongside tried-and-true data tools like SQL, R, SPSS, STATA, Python, and Microsoft 365.
The Analyst will conduct research on all existing systems, identify and recommend critical indicators for regular reporting to Office of the General Counsel (OGC) leadership, and build the necessary tools for extracting, organizing, analyzing, and visualizing such data. These analytics will be incorporated into OGC leadership’s regular planning processes and the analyst will maintain a key role in training OGC stakeholders in the interpretation and use of data assets. The Senior Data Analyst is a high-impact role in the newly formed OSA to build responsive government in New York City.

OGC faces significant challenges in using its many disparate and often antiquated case management systems to extract critical intel and develop key performance indicators for staffing, case triage, litigation approach, fraud-tracking and prevention, settlement opportunities, and policymaking. Developing these metrics is essential for OGC to shape a successful case management and resolution strategy in NYCPS’s ever-changing environment.
The Mission:
The Office of Systems and Analytics’ unique mission is to reimagine the ineffective systems & protocols that disproportionately impact marginalized communities and impede the larger OGC in its mission to provide ethical legal counsel & representation and create safe & inclusive learning environments. Our goal is to empower OGC with modern analytics, business intelligence, and a robust data culture to create a vibrant community of well-trained, technically competent, inclusive, collaborative, and focused legal professionals.
